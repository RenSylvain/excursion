# excursion
Codecademy project to practice all steps in creating, hosting, and publishing a site.

## Note
* Learned crucial little random thing. When html file links to style sheet (style.css), don't use a './' before the file path. If you do this it won't link when posted to GitHub and you visit the site via GitHub hosting.
